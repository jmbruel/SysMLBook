The *CMSS system* is a distributed crash management system that is responsible for 
coordinating the communication between a fire station coordinator (FSC) and a police station 
coordinator (PSC) to handle a crisis in a timely manner. Internal communication 
among the police personnel (including the PSC) is outside the scope of the desired system. The 
same assumption applies to the fire personnel (including the FSC). Information regarding the crisis 
as it pertains to the tasks of the coordinators will be updated and maintained during and after the 
crisis. 

There are two collaborative sub-systems. Thus, the global coordination is the result of the 
parallel composition of the (software) coordination processes controlled by the two (human) 
distributed coordinators (i.e., PSC and FSC). There is no central database; fire and police stations 
maintain separate databases and may only access information from the other database through the 
CMSS system. Each coordination process is hence in charge of adding and updating information in 
its respective database. 

For simplicity, the context of the CMSS system is an accident involving an overturned oil tanker 
on a highway, where the tanker is on fire. The actual execution of the mission (e.g., rescue victims 
or remove obstacles) is outside the scope of the CMSS system except for specific information 
about the mission as required by the coordinators. Furthermore, the current version of the 
CMSS system assumes that sufficient resources are available (e.g., fire trucks). Finally, there is 
only one fire station and only one police station and only one crisis at a time. 

CMSS starts operating at the point when a given crisis has been detected and declared both at the 
fire station and the police station, independently. The coordinators (i.e., PSC and FSC) have 
already defined the parameters necessary to start handling the crisis. The initial emergency call of a 
witness and any subsequent notifications of the crisis from additional witnesses through either the 
police station and/or fire station call centers are outside the scope of the desired system. 
A number of policies exist governing the timing for actions to be completed, the number of 
vehicles to be deployed for different types of crises, etc. The development and compliance checking 
of these policies are outside the scope of the desired system. 

All stakeholders of the system are detailed in the following. After a brief description of a 
stakeholder, the objectives of the stakeholder are first stated. Thereafter, the responsibilities
of the stakeholder are detailed which help to achieve the stakeholderâ€™s objectives to a certain 
degree. While the objectives characterize the general problems addressed by the CMSS system, the 
responsibilities describe concrete actions that are expected from a stakeholder. Responsibilities that cannot be traced to the use case are outside the scope of the 
system.

=== Fire Station Coordinator (FSC) 
A FSC maintains control over a crisis situation by communicating with the police station 
coordinator (PSC) as well as firemen. 
The objectives of a FSC are: 

- to handle a crisis efficiently and effectively (e.g., minimize loss or injury to people and 
property), 
- to get resources to the crisis location in the shortest amount of time, 
- to have accurate estimation of resource needs and time of arrivals for resources, 
- to have effective negotiation skills (e.g., with other coordinators), 
- to have dependable communication with involved stakeholders, 
- to maintain a feeling of control over the crisis (e.g., minimize stress level by providing and 
receiving crisis information to and from other coordinators in a timely fashion), and 
- to provide clear, executable instructions to appropriate staff. 

In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a FSC are: 

- to determine where, when, and how many fire trucks to send, 
- to communicate with the PSC to introduce herself, 
- to keep PSC up to date regarding the nature of the crisis and the deployed resources, 
- to propose a strategy for handling the crisis, 
- to reach an agreement with the PSC on how to proceed, 
- to receive updates regarding the crisis from individual firemen, and 
- to collate and distribute updated information and instructions back to the firemen. 

=== Fireman 
A fireman acts on orders received from the FSC and reports crisis-related information back to the 
FSC. Furthermore, a fireman communicates with other firemen, victims, and witnesses at the crisis 
location. 
The objectives of a fireman are: 

- to stay alive, 
- to minimize injury, 
- to save and support the victim, 
- to minimize damage to property, 
- to work well in a team, 
- to have confidence in the coordinator and follow instructions well, and 
- to keep up to date regarding the crisis situation. 

In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a fireman are: 

- to receive requests to go to/return from the crisis location, 
- to report location status to FSC, 
- to report conditions of the crisis to FSC and all firemen, and 
- to communicate with the victim and the witness at the crisis location. 

=== Police Station Coordinator (PSC) 
A PSC maintains control over a crisis situation by communicating with the fire station coordinator 
(FSC) as well as policemen. 
The objectives of a PSC are the same as the objectives of a FSC. 
In order to achieve these objectives, a PSC performs the same activities as a FSC. The description 
in Section 3.1 hence applies except that fire trucks are replaced with police cars, PSC with FSC, 
and firemen with policemen. 

=== Police Officer 
A police officer acts on orders received from the PSC and reports crisis-related information back to 
the PSC. Furthermore, a police officer communicates with other policemen, victims, and witnesses 
at the crisis location. 
The objectives of a police officer are the same as the objectives of a fireman. In addition, a police 
officer wants to re-establish order disturbed by a crisis (e.g., manage traffic and people). 
In order to achieve these objectives, a police officer performs the same activities as a fireman in 
terms of communicating with his coordinator. Hence, the description in Section 3.2 applies except 
that FSC is replaced with PSC. 

=== Victim 
A victim has been adversely affected by the crisis and may communicate with policemen and firemen. 
The objectives of a victim are: 

- to be rescued in the shortest amount of time, 
- to recover from injuries and/or loss in the shortest amount of time, 
- to minimize stress caused by the crisis, 
- to be informed of crisis status as it impacts the victim, and 
- to know what to do at different stages of the crisis. 

In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a victim are: 

- to provide crisis-related information (including information about their location, identity, 
and medical history) to firemen and policemen, and 
- to follow instructions from firemen and policemen. 

=== Witness (at the crisis location) 
A witness has observed the crisis and communicates with policemen and firemen. 
The objectives of a witness are: 

- to provide accurate information about the crisis to the police and fire personnel, and 
- to know what to do. 

In order to achieve these objectives, the responsibilities of a witness are: 

- to provide information to firemen and policemen, and 
- to follow instructions from firemen and policemen.
