This package contains LaTeX support for the fonts DejaVu. They are derived
from the Vera fonts and contain more characters and styles.

The fonts are included in the original TrueType format and converted
Type 1 format.

The (currently) supported encodings are: OT1, T1, IL2, TS1, T2*, X2, QX
and LGR. The package (currently) doesn't support math. More encodings
and/or features will come later.

The fonts are licensed under the Vera and Arev licenses, DejaVu changes
are in the public domain. All the support files are released under the
LaTeX Project Public License, either version 1.3 of this license or
(at your option) any later version. The files released under the LaTeX
Project Public License are listed in manifest.txt.

The main reason why I created this package is that I am not satisfied
with the Arev and Bera packages for the Czech language, but some problems
are not just Czech-related. Moreover, you get more characters and styles.
