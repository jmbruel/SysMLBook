        * Released version 1.34.
	
2003-10-04    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* pychart/legend.py (Entry.label_width): Changed the legend sample
	line and box size to be scaled with theme.default_font_size.

2003-10-04  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@godi.hpl.hp.com>

	* pychart/basecanvas.py (T.set_title): Added a couple of methods,
	e.g., set_creator, set_title, set_creation_date, to canvas.T to
	control the file headers.

2003-09-30  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@godi.hpl.hp.com>

	* pychart/range_plot.py (T.draw): Allowed line_style in range_plot
	to be None.

2003-09-28    <ysaito@STARFISH>
	* Added a rose chart. Contribution by Kilian Hagemann

	* pychart/pngcanvas.py (T.close): Allowed passing a file-like
	object (e.g., StringIO) to canvas.init(). This works for ps, pdf,
	svg, and and png.

2003-06-21  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@godi.hpl.hp.com>

	* pychart/gs_frontend.py (T.start_gs): Quoted the gs pathname to
	support Windows machines that put gs in "c:/Program Files/",
	(reported by Norm Davis).

2003-06-07  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@godi.hpl.hp.com>

	* pychart/bar_plot.py: error bar drawing was broken. Fixed. Thanks
	to David Douard.

        * Released version 1.33.
	
	* pychart/pie_plot.py: Added label_format attribute to pie plots.

	* pychart/bar_plot.py: Allowed changing the width and cluster_sep of
	bars individually. See demos/unevenbars.py for an example.
	
2003-02-23    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* Added interval_bar_plot. Released version 1.31.

2003-01-07  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@godi.hpl.hp.com>

	* Released version 1.30.

	* pychart/legend.py (T.draw): Fixed multi-column drawing. Thanks
	to Nicolas Fugier.

2002-12-18  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@godi.hpl.hp.com>

	* Updated documentation quite a bit. Released version 1.29.

2002-12-17    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* Backed out some changes not supported by Python/Jython 2.1.

2002-12-14    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* Added "draw_tics_{right,above}" attributes to axis.{X,Y}.

2002-10-25  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>
	* Released version 1.28.1
	* Replaced constants True and False with 1 and 0. I didn't know
	that python 2.2.0 didn't support them.

2002-10-26    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* pychart/pychart_util.py (union_dict): Changed XXXType()
	functions to return None when the type matches.

2002-10-24  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>
	* Released version 1.28.
	
	* Added an SVG support. Thanks to Patrick Surry.

	* Removed support for Python 1.5, now that Redhat comes with
	python2.

2002-10-09    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* README (http): Released version 1.27.

	* Removed (some of) the dependencies on ghostscript. Added
	genafm.py that converts Ghostscript's AFM files to an internal
	format. By including these internal-format files in the
	distribution, Pychart no longer needs ghostscript during
	execution.
 
2002-10-07    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* Allowed passing value "None" as sample values. Pychart just
	ignores them.

2002-10-05    <ysaito@STARFISH>
        * Released version 1.26.
	
	* pychart/tick_mark.py (gray70circle1): Added a bit more standard
	tick marks.

	* pychart/font.py: Added "/F{family}" escape sequence for
	specifying the font family explicitly. E.g.,
	"/F{ZapfDingbat}funny".  Stopped relying on Ghostscript for font
	metrics information.  Files under pychart/afm contain files
	converted from Ghostscript AFM distribution.

	* Supported Jython.

	* pychart/chart_object.py (set_defaults): args to apply() used be
	missing. Thanks for Patrik Surry for discovering this problem.

	* pychart/gs_frontend.py (T.__write_contents): Removed hardwired
	reference to "gs". Instead, we now search for a path that looks
	like a ghostscript executable. 

2002-10-01  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* demos/zaptest.py (ar): Added simple "zapping" example.

	* pychart/bar_plot.py (T.get_data_range): Fixed the
	auto-computation of upper/lower bounds of bar plots when they are
	stacked on top of each other.

	* pychart/area.py: Changed the handling of coordinate
	system. Instead of passing a string "linear", "log", or "category"
	to the area.T object, we now pass an instance of linear_coord.T,
	log_coord.T, or category_coord.T to area.x_coord or area.y_coord.
	This allows for more cleaner separation between the coordinate
	system and the area drawing. For example:

	ar = area.T(x_coord_system = "linear", ...)

	becomes

	ar = area.T(x_coord = linear_coord.T(), ...)

	ar = area.T(x_coord_system = "category", x_category_data = data,
	            x_category_col = col, ...)

	becomes
	
	ar = area.T(x_coord = category_coord.T(data, col), ...)
	

2002-09-28    <ysaito@YSAITO6000>

	* pychart/legend.py: Added multi-column legends. Set "nr_rows" to
	be a value smaller than the number of plots in the chart.

2002-09-20  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>

	* Updated documentations.

2002-08-21  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* pychart/font.py (unaligned_get_dimension): Changed the default
	value of theme.default_line_height to be None. If it is none,
	it is assumed to be equal to theme.default_font_size.

	* pychart/legend.py (Entry.height): handling of inter_row_sep is
	totally broken. Fixed.

2002-07-17  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>

	* pychart/font.py (quotemeta): Added function "font.quotemeta"
	that converts "/" to "//" so that the string will display
	correctly when passed to canvas.show().
	
	(_afm_line_re_pat): changed to delay reading the "fontmap" file so 
	that the new font_dump_path value will be reflected properly.

2002-07-15  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>
	* pychart/axis.py: minor tic lines wouldn't work. Fixed.

	* pychart/font.py (__font_dump_path): Added "font-dump-dir=DIR"
	option to both PYCHART_OPTIONS and the command line opts.  This
	option changes the location of font metrics dump directory, which
	defaults to ~/.pychart-xxxx in UNIX-based systems, c:/winnt/temp
	in Windows systems.

2002-07-10  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* Renamed theme.parse_cmdline_options to theme.getopt to 
	theme.get_options.  The last change is due to some arcane python1.5
	restriction about module naming.

	* Fixed a bug in which horizontal bar plots choke with a category
	axis.

	* The legend is by default displayed, unless you explicitly
	say 

	ar = area.T(legend = None, ...)

	* Supported drawing axes in an offset position. See demos/double.py
	for an example.
	
2002-06-05  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>

	* Enabled generating PNG files on Windows platforms. There was
	some problem piping data to Ghostscript.

2002-06-03    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* pychart/font.py: Fixed dimension calculation for multi-line texts.

	* pychart/line_style.py (init): grayXXdashY is renamed to
	grayXX_dashY. For example, gray7dash3 is now gray70_dash3.

	* pychart/color.py (T.__str__): Added all the color names found in
	X11 rgb.txt.
	
	* pychart/color.py (T.__str__): Changed the naming scheme of
	color.grayXX to match that of rgb.txt in X. For example, gray1 is
	renamed to gray10, gray5 is renamed to gray50, etc. Also, to avoid
	confusion, colors known as "gray1" in rgb.txt (or gray2, gray3,
	etc) are renamed to gray01, gray02, gray03, etc.

2002-05-19    <ysaito@STARFISH>

	* area.py: removed x_log_base and y_log_base attributes. They are
	substituted by axis.[XY].tic_interval.

2002-05-02  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* The handling of /cXXX attribute was broken. Thanks for Scott
	Sandholm for uncovering this bug.

2002-04-24  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* pychart/theme.py: added parse_cmdline_options

2002-04-23  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito0.hpl.hp.com>

	* afmPaths -> _afm_paths.

2002-04-21  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* Added support for pydoc. 

2002-04-20  Yasushi Saito  <ysaito@ysaito1>

	* Added a PNG backend. You need a fairly recent ghostscript to
	use this backend. Either saying "output=foo.png" or
	"format=png" in PYCHART_OPTIONS will activate this backend.

	* Added a X11 backend, though it still acts a bit funky sometimes.
	Say "format=x11" in PYCHART_OPTIONS.

	* Supported producing multiple files in a single script via 
	canvas.init(FILE) method.
	
2002-04-19    <ysaito@YSAITO6000>

	* Changed y_min_col to y_error_minus_col. y_max_Col is changed to
	y_error_plus_col. 

	* Changed q_min_col to y_qerror_minus_col. q_max_Col is changed to
	y_qerror_plus_col. 

2000-06-13  Yasushi Saito  <yasushi@sys203.cs.washington.edu>

	* Changed /c, /h, /t to /C, /H, /T.  

	* Added /hXX option to text formatting to change inter-line
	spacing.
	
	* Added "vertial alignment" options to Canvas.show.
	
2000-05-31  Yasushi Saito  <yasushi@localhost.localdomain>

	* The document file used to refer to nonexistent links
	* Changed the doc file name to index.html
	* Legend and other textbox stuff correctly included in the bounding 
	box calculation.

2000-05-30  Yasushi Saito  <yasushi@localhost.localdomain>

	* Changed clipping to use gsave/grestore instead of explicit
        "initclip" this makes recursive clipping easier.
	* Added the definition of "max" in preamble.ps
	* Released the version 0.14
	* Switched from TeX to TeXinfo. Updated documents
