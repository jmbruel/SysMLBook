== FAQ

Cette _**F**requently **A**sked **Q**uestion_ a été construite par expérience, en regroupant 
les questions des étudiants durant mes différentes interventions. 
J'ai aussi ajouté des questions souvent rencontrées dans les journées organisés par {sysmlfrance}. 

NOTE: Voir aussi cette http://www.sysmlforum.com/faq[FAQ] très bien faite.

Cette FAQ peut servir de base à la révision d'examens (cf. aussi <<Exos>>).

=== What is the current version of SysML and how can I obtain it?

Verson 1.3 and here is the specification link: http://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?formal/10-06-02.

=== What changes were made during the last revision?

Notable changes in Version 1.2 of SysML include:

- Synchronization with changes in UML 2.3
- Conjugate ports metamodel and notation 
- Naming of interruptible activity regions 
- Inclusion of UML instance specifications
 -Inclusion of UML structured activity nodes 
- Inclusion of UML multiple item flow notation
- Improvements to Unit and QuantityKind support for value types, and a non-normative model to define systems of units and quantities

NOTE: The SysML v1.3 Revision Task Force led by Roger Burkhart and Rick Steiner is continuing to work on proposed improvements to SysML based on feedback from the systems modeling community.


=== How do we setup ranges (limits) of (input) variables (in a par for example)?

In the details or the definition of the Flow Item.

=== What does the +\{strict\}+ keyword means for profile application?

No other meta-elements than the one in the applied profile were used (e.g., you can use a tool supporting the profile with confidence).

[quote, SysML1.2 p. 8]
____________________________________________________________________
The semantics of UML profiles ensure that when a user model “strictly” applies the SysML profile, only the UML metaclasses referenced by SysML are available to the user of that model. If the
profile is not “strictly” applied, then additional UML metaclasses that were not explicitly referenced may also be available.

=== What does the visibility (+private+, +public+, ...) means for a block?

As any model elements, the visibility of a block describes how it can be imported outside its namespace.

NOTE: It depends on the tool support for visibility controls to use this feature.

=== What is the difference between an internal and a self transition?

In a self transition the exit and the the entry events are trigered.

=== Can I attach a History pseudostate to a particular (non composite) state?

No. The History pseudostate (H) is indicated inside a composite state and means that when back in this superstate, the machine goes back to its last active state.

- What is the roadmap for OMG SysML 2.0?
- Who are the SysML Partners?
- What is the relationship between UML and SysML? Can SysML and UML be used together?
- Can SysML be customized?
- Which language is easier to learn, SysML or UML?
